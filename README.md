# [Deprecated] CS:GO GSI for Artemis

**This plugin doesn't work with the newest version of Artemis, please check out the new version in the official [Artemis.Plugins.Games](https://github.com/Artemis-RGB/Artemis.Plugins.Games) repo instead!**

~~This module is in beta: please report any bugs that you see!~~

~~First, install this plugin. You can find the zipped plugin on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/AlpacaFur/Artemis.CSGO/releases).~~

~~Then, you'll have to place the GSI config file. To set it up, place the `gamestate_integration_artemis.cfg` file inside your CS:GO cfg folder (typically located `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg"`).~~

~~For more info on what the different properties mean, [check here](datamodel.md).~~
