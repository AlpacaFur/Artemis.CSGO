# CS:GO GSI for Artemis

This module is in beta: please report any bugs that you see! 

First, install this module. Then, you'll have to place the GSI config file. To set it up, place the `gamestate_integration_artemis.cfg` file inside your CS:GO cfg folder (typically located `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg"`) and the built plugin in your Artemis plugins folder.
