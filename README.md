# CS:GO GSI for Artemis

This module really doesn't work right now, so use at your own risk.

To set it up, place the `gamestate_integration_artemis.cfg` inside your CS:GO cfg folder (typically located `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg"`) and the built plugin in your Artemis plugins folder.
